# Dispatch Earnings Calculator

This repository contains a simple calculator for estimating the dispatch team's earnings for a load. The interface and logic live entirely in static files so you can open them directly in your browser.

## Project structure

- `index.html` – the original single-page calculator experience.
- `main.html` – an alternate entry point with the exact same markup, styling, and scripting as `index.html`. Open this file directly in your browser if you specifically need the `main.html` name.
- `rate_calculator.css` – shared styles for the calculator UI.

## Getting started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open either `index.html` or `main.html` in any modern browser.
3. Enter the miles driven and the load payout to calculate the dispatch earnings.

No additional build steps or dependencies are required.
